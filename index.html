      <p>-Coding. One of the most common and basic skill sets an employer requires from an IT professional is the
        ability to write code. Most IT jobs perform programming and software and web development tasks. It is also
        beneficial to have coding skills in several languages such as C++, Python, Java and Ruby.

      <p>Here are 22 popular IT skills that you can seize in 2022 to unlock your potential and advance your IT career.
      </p>

      <h4>1. Networking</h4>
      <p>Nearly everything we do starts with the network, so a well-rounded IT pro knows that it is important to
        understand the technology behind computer networking.</p>

      <h4>2. Cloud computing</h4>
      <p>As remote work has increased, so has the demand for cloud computing. Cloud computing skills – such as
        configuration, deployment, security, management and troubleshooting – are essential to IT pros since. This
        includes everything from end user support for software as a service (SaaS) solutions to analyzing, managing,
        maintaining and deploying cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

      <h4>3. Technical support</h4>
      <p>There is a reason many IT pros begin their careers in technical support. The troubleshooting and
        problem-solving skills honed at the help desk give you a solid foundation that you’ll use again and again
        throughout your career, no matter what specialty you go into.</p>

      <h4>4. Linux</h4>
      <p>This year, companies are relying on IT pros to know how to operate Linux successfully. Basic maintenance,
        installing and configuring workstations, networking and understanding the Linux command line are skills that
        tech workers should start mastering now.</p>

      <h4>5. Programming languages</h4>
      <p>To say that understanding programming languages – such as Java, JavaScript, C++ and Python – is an IT skill
        currently in demand is an understatement. Programming languages touch nearly every IT job role, so IT pros would
        benefit from strengthening these skills.</p>

      <h4>6. User experience (UX)</h4>
      <p>Proper UX design is valuable because it can help to increase productivity, decrease support costs and boost
        customer retention and acquisition. Each of these benefits is attractive to organizations navigating another
        challenging year and striving to create a healthier bottom line. IT pros can learn UX design – such as knowledge
        of researching target markets, visual design skills, coding and project management skills – to establish
        themselves as experts in the tech industry.</p>

      <h4>7. Machine learning</h4>
      <p>There are many skills that fall under the heading of machine learning. IT pros can start with software
        engineering, systems design, computer science fundamentals and programming. These competencies will help you
        begin finding patterns in data.</p>

      <h4>8. Quality assurance</h4>
      <p>Someone who does quality assurance uses data analytics to identify issues and opportunities in products that
        are created by a factory or business process. They make sure things are done right, minimizing errors and
        vulnerabilities.</p>

      <h4>9. Mobile application skills</h4>
      <p>Organizations are increasingly turning to mobile app solutions to expand customer reach. Understanding
        application programming interface (API) development platforms and cross-platform app development frameworks will
        help IT specialists develop mobile applications and create new digital solutions.

      </p>

      <h4>10. Risk analysis</h4>
      <p>Risk analysis is the assessment of risks and vulnerabilities that could negatively impact an organization. With
        more cybercrime than ever before, cybersecurity skills like risk identification, analysis and management help IT
        pros keep organizations’ sensitive data safe.

      </p>

      <h4>11. Cybersecurity analytics
      </h4>
      <p>At the intersection of cybersecurity and data analytics is cybersecurity analytics. In a cloudy world that
        doesn’t have secure perimeters, there is a critical need to secure data. This includes threat intelligence,
        intrusion detection and response, risk analysis and data modeling.

      <h4>12. Penetration testing
      </h4>
      <p>Penetration testing is a way of finding vulnerabilities in your systems before a cybercriminal does. While
        cybersecurity analysis is considered a defensive strategy, penetration testing would be an offensive strategy.
        Both sides work together to protect the organization in different ways.

      </p>

      <h4>13. Compliance
      </h4>
      <p>Compliance is defined as the actions or facts of complying to a regulation. It is important to understand the
        background behind compliance as it is used in many aspects of security and extra cybersecurity tasks.

      </p>

      <h4>14. Database administration
      </h4>
      <p>When it comes to configuring and maintaining the database management system or updating database code for
        upcoming new technology, a database administrator is there to manage all aspects of an organized database
        environment. Within data administration is a highly used programming language, Structured Query Language (SQL).
        SQL is the standard programming language for relational databases, and it is important that IT pros know how to
        structure and manage these databases. Those wanting to move into a database administrator role should make it
        their mission to learn SQL inside and out.

      </p>

      <h4>15. Data analytics
      </h4>
      <p>An IT pro that is well-versed in data analytics has the ability to examine data sets and reach conclusions to
        help their organization get better results. As a top IT skill in demand this year, it is vital that tech
        specialists learn the art of data analytics. Gaining some of the skills listed earlier – such as machine
        learning and programming languages – will strengthen your data analytics skill set.

      </p>

      <h4>16. Data visualization
      </h4>
      <p>Data sets can be complex and hard to understand. Organizations need people who are able to analyze it and
        create data visualizations to tell the story of what the data means and why stakeholders should care. Data
        visualization helps guide decision making across the organization.

      </p>

      <h4>17. Data science
      </h4>
      <p>Organizations need employees who can interpret raw data and transform it into usable feedback that data
        analysts can use to guide decision making. Learning to work with a variety of programming languages (SAS, R and
        Python, for example) can help IT pros do this.

      </p>

      <h4>18. Big data
      </h4>
      <p>Big data refers to the use of new technology tools to handle data that previously could not be handled with
        existing tools. IT skills in demand in 2022 that are related to big data include effective problem solving
        skills, data handling skills and understanding programming languages. By pursuing these competencies and
        utilizing these tools, you can advance your career.

      <h4>19. Professional skills
      </h4>
      <p>In addition to technical skills, IT pros should bring a variety of professional skills to the table this year.
        Adaptability, empathy, teamwork, communication and active listening are just as important to employers as
        technical skills are. With that in mind, building and strengthening your professional skills should be a top
        priority for IT specialists.

      </p>

      <h4>20. Project management
      </h4>
      <p>Project management skills can be applied across the board and make you better at your job regardless of the
        size of projects you’re managing. Understanding project management methodologies as well as learning how to
        manage the project lifecycle and communicate with stakeholders will add efficiency and effectiveness to your
        work.

      </p>

      <h4>21. Automation
      </h4>
      <p>Automation boosts efficiency, which is exactly what many companies need; and IT pros can implement it at every
        level, from the help desk to cybersecurity.

      </p>

      <h4>22. Business skills
      </h4>
      <p>While professional skills refer to how you behave, business skills are more about what you know. As an IT pro,
        the more you understand about how your organization functions, what the business priorities and goals are, and
        what challenges employees and end users are facing, the better you’re able to recommend solutions.
